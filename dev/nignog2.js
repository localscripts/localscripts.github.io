The main distinction is that [Zenith](/) is actively maintained, whereas [Nihon](/) is still undergoing redevelopment. [Zenith](/) offers a smooth experience and is bundled into a single `.exe` file, unlike many other exploits that come in `.zip` archives with multiple `.dll` files.\n  \n\n## Background Information  \n- Before [Zenith](/), an executor - [Nihon](/) launched in early 2024 and officially released on October 24, 2024, delivering strong performance.  \n- On February 3, 2025, [Nihon](/) team splited. The [Nihon](/) owner commented on the situation:  \n  *\"A former admin and Sero nuked the server and banned users. We're restoring it—Zenith wasn't involved and even returned our vanity. ❤️\"*. No further details were provided, though the situation is likely more complex.  \n\n## Developers Background Information\n- There is little background information available about the owners, [Immune](/), aside from their primary role in working on the UI for [Nihon](/). The rest of the development team included [@loadnil](/), [@mcgamin1738](/) and [@lendmeyourstrength](), who were primarily responsible for both the back-end and front-end development of Nihon. \n\n- Later, the team was forced to leave [Nihon](/), leading the developers to found [Zenith](/), which has been doing quite well. The current main owners are [@loadnil](/), [@lendmeyourstrength](/), [@mcgamin1738](/), and [@spectraluwu](/).\n\n\n> Sources: Reddit.com/r/robloxhackers, Zenith & Nihon Developers",

The developers focus on avoiding detection and ban waves by using Hyperion emulation techniques. However, running the official Roblox client can still be inconvenient, as it requires reinstallation, and users may occasionally face bans even when using [AWP.gg](/).\n\n> \n\n## Background Information  \n- There is speculation that [AWP.gg](/) is linked to [Krampus](/), an exploit that abruptly shut down on May 11, 2024, shortly after the release of Hyperion 4.0. The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support. The shutdown was likely due to the challenges in bypassing the new Hyperion 4.0. Although [Krampus](/) did not distribute malware, they issued a misleading "official explanation," falsely claiming their developers were "raided" and even circulating fabricated images as evidence in their Discord server.\n  \n- After months of inactivity, the [Krampus](/) Discord suddenly began promoting a Robux gambling site. It\'s unclear whether the developers are behind the site or were paid for sponsorship, but it\'s most likely that the Discord server was simply sold off.\n\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- Currently managed by [@merkuri6479](/), [@jbhglj7uj](/), and [@etheriut](/), but no additional information is known about them.\n\n\n \n\n> Sources: Reddit.com/r/robloxhackers, WeAreDevs.NET',

It’s associated with [WeAreDevs](), a platform that has made [KRNL]() widely accessible—though not without controversy due to the site's history with unreliable exploits.\n- Over time, [KRNL]() has become one of the most widely-used free executors, rivaling even some paid ones in terms of performance. It often receives updates within hours of a Roblox patch, minimizing downtime for users.\n- After the introduction of [Hyperion]() (Byfron’s anti-cheat), [KRNL]() temporarily halted updates. Once users discovered the UWP (Microsoft Store version of Roblox) didn’t have [Byfron]() protection, [KRNL]() shifted support to UWP. However, this was short-lived as [Byfron]() was later implemented in UWP as well, leading to its discontinuation.\n\n##  Developer Background \n- [KRNL]() was developed by [Ice Bear](), known for maintaining a clean and reliable exploit.

Also, when downloading the loader, it doesn\'t actually download the exploit — it downloads your user data.\n\n## Background Information\n- Formerly known as [Atlantis](/), it was rebranded to [Ratlantis](/), and after being exposed for making a rat with ChatGPT, it was renamed again to [RatWare](/), then got exposed again for leaving an unprotected WebHook named `UserLogs`, with the webhook using a rat as its avatar.\n- After being exposed, [@sens6222](/) made an announcement saying "Fuck incognito pastes" and changed [RatWare\'s](/) WebHook to continue downloading user data, but it was left unprotected again, allowing skids to delete it.\n\n\n\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- The exploit is made by [@sens6222](/), but users sometimes encounter an "Error Ratting User" message due to [@sens6222](/) using ChatGPT and not bothering to edit the script.\n',
