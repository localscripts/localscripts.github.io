-- I HAD NEVER WRITTEN A SCRIPT, JUST LEAVING AS DRAFT

On **October 11, 2022**, **Byfron**, a new anti-cheat system for Roblox, was introduced on the Roblox Developer Forum, with **Hyperion** being mentioned in relation to it. At that time, the community was uncertain about what to expect, and many were anxious. Hyperion, known for being used by **Fortnite**, led to widespread speculation. Some players feared it would be as invasive as Fortnite's anti-tamper measures, such as Kernel. However, the true impact remained unclear for a while.

On **March 5, 2023**, Roblox released the **64-bit client** version to the live channel, which affected all users. This release sparked chaos on the forums. Popular exploits like **Script-Ware** and **KRNL** shut down, with many thinking this marked the end of Roblox exploiting. The exploit community on Windows went silent for a time. However, exploits on **Mac** and **Mobile** devices continued as if nothing had changed. Some users also resorted to **emulating Android** on Windows to bypass the changes, but this method was unstable and less popular.

Initially, the **32-bit client** or **ZIntegration** channel was a workaround to avoid Hyperion. However, this solution didnâ€™t last long, and the situation continued to evolve.

On **September 27, 2023**, a new exploit called **Rouge** emerged. It gained attention due to its involvement with well-known developers like **Shade**. However, the project was surrounded by suspicion. Rouge was available only for pre-order, with a hefty price tag of **$100** for lifetime access. The exploit lacked a proper website, which raised red flags. Despite having reputable developers involved, they were not actively working on the project, which seemed to be a tactic to appear legitimate. Eventually, it turned out to be an **exit scam**, with **Reversed**, the creator, claiming to refund only some of the buyers, but it was unclear who received refunds.

On **September 15, 2023**, Roblox began **A/B testing** for the **64-bit update** on the **Microsoft Store (UWP)** client. Some users received the update with Hyperion, while others did not. Many users simply chose not to update and continued using the older version. To address this, some developers started banning users still on the **32-bit client**, detecting their architecture through scripts. There were rumors that Roblox might be using the **32-bit client** as a **honeypot**, identifying and **HWID banning** exploiters.
