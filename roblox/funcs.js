No further details were provided, though the situation is likely more complex.  \n\n## Developers Background Information\n- There is little background information available about the owners, [@Immune](/), aside from their primary role in working on the UI for [Nihon](/). The rest of the development team included [@loadnil](/), [@mcgamin1738](/) and [@lendmeyourstrength](), who were primarily responsible for both the back-end and front-end development of Nihon. \n\n- Later, the team was forced to leave [Nihon](/), leading the developers to found [Zenith](/), which has been doing quite well.

Since December, [Wave]() has shown better performance and has been more consistent.\n  However, the UI and other features haven't seen much attention or updates since then.\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- Currently owned by [@Tiahh]().

The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support. The shutdown was likely due to the challenges in bypassing the new Hyperion 4.0. Although [Krampus](/) did not distribute malware, they issued a misleading \"official explanation,\" falsely claiming their developers were \"raided\" and even circulating fabricated images as evidence in their Discord server.\n  \n- After months of inactivity, the [Krampus](/) Discord suddenly began promoting a Robux gambling site. It's unclear whether the developers are behind the site or were paid for sponsorship, but it's most likely that the Discord server was simply sold off.\n\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- Currently managed by [@merkuri6479](/), [@jbhglj7uj](/), and [@etheriut](/), but no additional information is known about them.\n\n\n \n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), WeAreDevs.NET",

The project began as a simple external, but development significantly accelerated after [@slamfrags]() was removed from the team about four months ago.\n* Since then, [Matcha]() has seen rapid daily improvements, even with [Vault]() balancing school responsibilities. [Vain]() was appointed to manage the staff team, ensuring better coordination and internal operations.\n* The exploit originally started from a casual DM where [@slamfrags]() asked [Vault]() to build an external for Roblox. [Vault]() agreed, partly due to financial needs at the time. While [@slamfrags]() handled promotion, [Vault]() focused on development. However, over time, [@slamfrags]() became known for mismanaging funds, underpaying or outright ignoring the staff team, and showing unprofessional behavior, which led to staff members resigning.\n* Eventually, staff operations were handed over to [@vain](), who brought structure and fairness to the team. Staff members are now paid and their work is recognized. The current support team is publicly listed on [Matcha's Discord server]().\n\n## Developer Background Information\n\n* [Matcha]() is developed primarily by [Vault](), who writes the core cheat code, and [Decode](), who handles its security features. Both are still students.\n* The original management team consisted of [@geekn]() and [@slamfrags](). [@geekn]() left voluntarily, while [@slamfrags]() was removed due to being overpaid for minimal contributions and ongoing internal issues.\n* Following their removal, [Vault]() brought in close friends to help manage and support the project, which contributed to its steady and structured growth.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), Matcha Discord Moderator\n",

It has never been detected on Hyperion, offers a wide range of features, and updates faster than most competitors. Each version is optimized for top performance.\n\n### **Background Information**\n\n* [Nezur]() was founded in August 2023 and publicly released in October 2023 under [1Cheats](), a company behind multiple cheats for Roblox and Fortnite. It started as a small project but quickly grew due to its focus on security, user feedback, and staying undetected. With the release of [Nezur]() External 5.0, it was completely overhauled, gaining new features that rival and even surpass those of paid externals. It now includes per-game tools, acting as an all-in-one external hub. Although it's an external, [Nezur]() performs like an internal thanks to its optimized design. It uses a custom-built authentication system, and its backend infrastructure is fully owned and dedicated to [Nezur]().\n\n### **Developer Info**\n\n* [Nezur]() is developed by a skilled team experienced in web development, Java, and C++. The project is led by a developer active in the exploiting scene since 2019, known for releasing various scripthubs and tools over the years. While the team stays mostly private, they prioritize fast updates, strong security, and a smooth user experience. Looking forward, [Nezur]() plans to expand into both internal and external versions while continuing to stay ahead of detections.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), Nezur Team",
