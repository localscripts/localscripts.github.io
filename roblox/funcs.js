The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support.

[Valex]() uses a custom injection method unlike any other executor on the market, enabling smoother performance, fewer crashes, and high compatibility. It offers broad feature support, and receives updates faster than most competitors. Every version is optimized to ensure maximum performance and reliability.\n\n\n### **Background Information**\n\n* [Valex]() was originally launched as [Nezur]() in 2023 under [1Cheats](), the team behind well-known Roblox and Fortnite cheats. Originally started as an experiment to improve internal injection, [Valex]() quickly gained attention for its low detection rate, solid performance, and reliable updates. With its latest release, it introduced a redesigned core and UI, giving users advanced functionality previously limited to high-end paid exploits. Although internal, [Valex]() is simple to use and acts as a one-click solution for both casual and advanced users. It also runs on a fully custom backend with secure authentication, entirely owned and managed by the [Valex]() team.\n\n\n### **Developer Info**\n\n* [Valex]() is developed by a skilled and experienced team with backgrounds in C++, Java, and full-stack development. The project is led by a developer active in the exploit scene since 2019, known for creating several public scripthubs and tools. The team keeps a low profile but consistently delivers fast updates, prioritizes security, and ensures a smooth user experience. Future plans for [Valex]() include deeper internal integration, more per-game tools, and continued efforts to remain fully working.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), Valex Team",

The initial Roblox build was unstable, but after heavy trial and error, a solid version was completed in **late 2024**.

    info: "### Developers\nSeliware is powered by two skilled developers - Dx and z33r0x. Little is known about them, but in the pre-Byfron era, they were among the developers of TRX, a very popular executor in the CIS scene.\n\n### History  \nDuring its closed beta, Seliware had four core developers: z33r0x, Dx, Nezy, and 74235. Nezy and 74235 abandoned the team at a critical moment right before the release of Seliware, created their own product (Calibri) that was closed short after. After Seliware was released, straight-forward innovations were added and with each update it became better. In January, after the WinVerifyTrust hook injection method patch, Seliware was the third executor after AWP and Wave, which was updated. In April, Seliware, due to unforeseen circumstances within the team, closed for 3 weeks. After which it opened and all subscriptions were compensated. Now Seliware is the most performant executor on the paid executor market with very little RAM usage, which is very suitable for farmers.\n\n### Future\nRewrite of Seliware has been in development since December - it will be released as a new product under a different name, and all Seliware users with an active subscription at the time of release will receive its transfer. Seliware is also expected to be released for other platforms, such as macOS and iOS.\n\n### Interesting facts\n- GRH (creator of Synapse Z) helped with Seliware’s early development.  \n- Seliware holds the title of the second-longest surviving internal executor post-Hyperion, outlived only by Wave.",

In March 2022, [@lxnny]() — owner of [Delta](https://deltaexploits.gg) — reposted a community warning on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net), exposing [ArceusX]() for ratting users and scamming developers. Despite this, it remains widely used. In April 2024, [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com) launched [Wave](https://getwave.gg), a Windows executor combining [ArceusX]() and CodeX with an improved UI. While trusted, it’s still owned by the same team involved in past data issues. [ArceusX]() continues to receive regular updates.\n\n## Developer Background Information  \n- [ArceusX]() is owned by [Tiahh]() and [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com).
