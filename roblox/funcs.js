No further details were provided, though the situation is likely more complex.  \n\n## Developers Background Information\n- There is little background information available about the owners, [@Immune](/), aside from their primary role in working on the UI for [Nihon](/). The rest of the development team included [@loadnil](/), [@mcgamin1738](/) and [@lendmeyourstrength](), who were primarily responsible for both the back-end and front-end development of Nihon. \n\n- Later, the team was forced to leave [Nihon](/), leading the developers to found [Zenith](/), which has been doing quite well.

The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support. The shutdown was likely due to the challenges in bypassing the new Hyperion 4.0. Although [Krampus](/) did not distribute malware, they issued a misleading \"official explanation,\" falsely claiming their developers were \"raided\" and even circulating fabricated images as evidence in their Discord server.\n  \n- After months of inactivity, the [Krampus](/) Discord suddenly began promoting a Robux gambling site.
