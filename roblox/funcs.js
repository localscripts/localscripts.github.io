[Zenith](/) offers a smooth experience and is bundled into a single `.exe` file, unlike many other exploits that come in `.zip` archives with multiple `.dll` files.\n  \n\n## Background Information  \n- Before [Zenith](/), an executor - [Nihon](/) launched in early 2024 and officially released on October 24, 2024, delivering strong performance.  \n- On February 3, 2025, [Nihon](/) team splited. The [Nihon](/) owner commented on the situation:  \n  *\"A former admin and Sero nuked the server and banned users. We're restoring it—Zenith wasn't involved and even returned our vanity. ❤️\"*. No further details were provided, though the situation is likely more complex.  \n\n## Developers Background Information\n- There is little background information available about the owners, [Immune](/), aside from their primary role in working on the UI for [Nihon](/). The rest of the development team included [@loadnil](/), [@mcgamin1738](/) and [@lendmeyourstrength](), who were primarily responsible for both the back-end and front-end development of Nihon. \n\n- Later, the team was forced to leave [Nihon](/), leading the developers to found [Zenith](/), which has been doing quite well. The current main owners are [@loadnil](/), [@lendmeyourstrength](/), [@mcgamin1738](/), and [@spectraluwu](/).\n\n\n> Sources: Reddit.com/r/robloxhackers, Zenith & Nihon Developers",

The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support. The shutdown was likely due to the challenges in bypassing the new Hyperion 4.0. Although [Krampus](/) did not distribute malware, they issued a misleading "official explanation," falsely claiming their developers were "raided" and even circulating fabricated images as evidence in their Discord server.\n  \n- After months of inactivity, the [Krampus](/) Discord suddenly began promoting a Robux gambling site. It\'s unclear whether the developers are behind the site or were paid for sponsorship, but it\'s most likely that the Discord server was simply sold off.\n\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- Currently managed by [@merkuri6479](/), [@jbhglj7uj](/), and [@etheriut](/), but no additional information is known about them.\n\n\n \n\n> Sources: Reddit.com/r/robloxhackers, WeAreDevs.NET',

It often receives updates within hours of a Roblox patch, minimizing downtime for users.\n- After the introduction of [Hyperion]() (Byfron’s anti-cheat), [KRNL]() temporarily halted updates. Once users discovered the UWP (Microsoft Store version of Roblox) didn’t have [Byfron]() protection, [KRNL]() shifted support to UWP. However, this was short-lived as [Byfron]() was later implemented in UWP as well, leading to its discontinuation.\n\n##  Developer Background \n- [KRNL]() was developed by [Ice Bear](), known for maintaining a clean and reliable exploit.
