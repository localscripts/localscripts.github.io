No further details were provided, though the situation is likely more complex.  \n\n## Developers Background Information\n- There is little background information available about the owners, [@Immune](/), aside from their primary role in working on the UI for [Nihon](/).

The developers abandoned the project without offering any updates or refunds, leaving long-term license holders without support.

[Valex]() uses a custom injection method unlike any other executor on the market, enabling smoother performance, fewer crashes, and high compatibility. It offers broad feature support, and receives updates faster than most competitors. Every version is optimized to ensure maximum performance and reliability.\n\n\n### **Background Information**\n\n* [Valex]() was originally launched as [Nezur]() in 2023 under [1Cheats](), the team behind well-known Roblox and Fortnite cheats. Originally started as an experiment to improve internal injection, [Valex]() quickly gained attention for its low detection rate, solid performance, and reliable updates. With its latest release, it introduced a redesigned core and UI, giving users advanced functionality previously limited to high-end paid exploits. Although internal, [Valex]() is simple to use and acts as a one-click solution for both casual and advanced users. It also runs on a fully custom backend with secure authentication, entirely owned and managed by the [Valex]() team.\n\n\n### **Developer Info**\n\n* [Valex]() is developed by a skilled and experienced team with backgrounds in C++, Java, and full-stack development. The project is led by a developer active in the exploit scene since 2019, known for creating several public scripthubs and tools. The team keeps a low profile but consistently delivers fast updates, prioritizes security, and ensures a smooth user experience. Future plans for [Valex]() include deeper internal integration, more per-game tools, and continued efforts to remain fully working.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers](), Valex Team",

[@GuardianAngel]() shared the `.dll` files privately with friends, who later pushed him to release it publicly.

His track record includes continued leadership on [Swift](/), while now also overseeing Visual’s direction. [Blinx](/), the UI designer behind both the original Swift interface and Visual’s current look, brings a clean and consistent visual identity across projects. [Reveny](/) and [Viz](/), both software engineering majors and longtime collaborators of Peyton, contribute to the development of Visual. Though not publicly known in the community, their technical expertise ensures the project is both scalable and dependable.\n\n> Sources: Reddit.com/r/robloxhackers, Swift Discord, Visual Discord",

In March 2022, [@lxnny]() — owner of [Delta](https://deltaexploits.gg) — reposted a community warning on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net), exposing [ArceusX]() for ratting users and scamming developers. Despite this, it remains widely used. In April 2024, [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com) launched [Wave](https://getwave.gg), a Windows executor combining [ArceusX]() and CodeX with an improved UI. While trusted, it’s still owned by the same team involved in past data issues. [ArceusX]() continues to receive regular updates.\n\n## Developer Background Information  \n- [ArceusX]() is owned by [Tiahh]() and [SPDMTeam](https://spdmteam.com). There is limited public information about the developers.\n\n> Sources: [reddit.com/r/robloxhackers]()\n",

    info: '## Exploit Performance \n- Users have reported that while using [RatWare](/), their mouse randomly moves. [@sens6222](/) explains this happens because Hyperion detects RatWare for a split second, and it\'s supposedly fine. Also, when downloading the loader, it doesn\'t actually download the exploit — it downloads your user data.\n\n## Background Information\n- Formerly known as [Atlantis](/), it was rebranded to [Ratlantis](/), and after being exposed for making a rat with ChatGPT, it was renamed again to [RatWare](/), then got exposed again for leaving an unprotected WebHook named `UserLogs`, with the webhook using a rat as its avatar.\n- After being exposed, [@sens6222](/) made an announcement saying "Fuck incognito pastes" and changed [RatWare\'s](/) WebHook to continue downloading user data, but it was left unprotected again, allowing skids to delete it.\n\n\n\n\n## Developers Background Information\n- The exploit is made by [@sens6222](/), but users sometimes encounter an "Error Ratting User" message due to [@sens6222](/) using ChatGPT and not bothering to edit the script.\n',
