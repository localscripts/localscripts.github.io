# Project Setup Guide

Run this command to install the Github repo, it's needed for the rest of the instructions.
```powershell
git clone 'https://github.com/localscripts/localscripts.github.io.git' && cd localscripts.github.io'
```

## Public Server

There are two free static hosting providers that are the best:
1. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (*suggested*)
2. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

The instructions for both options are well documented and would add too much bloat if added here. [Instructions for Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/), and [instructions for Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

## Local Server (On your computer)

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**
  - Download and install from [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

If you want to see the website but not host it, follow the [quick and dirty](#quick-and-dirty) instructions. If you want to host the server in a public context, follow the [slow and robust](#slow-and-robust) instructions (not recommended when hosted on a personal device). 

### Quick and Dirty
1. Install the extension `Live Preview` (The publisher should be `microsoft.com`). If you can't find it using the extension explorer in VSCode, you can manually install it by going to [this site](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server).

2. Open the github repo in VSCode, right click `index.html` and select `Show Preview`. This will open a tab in VSCode. If you want to see the website in your browser, the just copy the URL in the VSCode tab and enter it in your preferred browser.

### Slow and Robust
1. **Install Python (if not already installed)**
  - Download and install from [Python](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install NPM (using WinGet)**
  - Run this Powershell line to install `npm`
    ```powershell
    winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS
    ```

3. **Open the Folder in Visual Studio Code**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code and open the extracted folder.
4. **Open a Terminal in Visual Studio Code**
  - Press `Ctrl+Shift+~` to open a new terminal window in Visual Studio Code.

5. **Install `http-server` Globally**
  - Run the following command to install `http-server`:
    ```sh
    npm install -g http-server
    ```
6. **Start a Python HTTP Server**
  - Run the following command to start a Python HTTP server:
    ```powershell
    python -m http.server
    ```
7. **Find Your Local IP Address**
  - Press `Windows+R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter` to open Command Prompt.
  - Run the command `ipconfig` and locate your IPv4 Address.

8. **Access Your Project in a Browser**
  - Open your browser and navigate to `<IP>:<Port>`. For example, if your IP address is `192.168.1.10` and the port is `8000`, enter `http://192.168.1.10:8000`. If you don't know your current local IP address, you can get it using this Powershell line:
    ```powershell
    Get-NetIPAddress | Where-Object {$_.AddressFamily -eq 'IPv4' -and $_.InterfaceAlias    -ne 'Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1'} | Select-Object IPAddress
    ```
  This will give several IP addresses, pick the first one that starts with `192`. The others are either APIPA addresses, loopback addresses, or explicitly set on your machine.
  - > [!IMPORTANT]
    > NOTE: that step can be skipped and you can go directly to either `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000`  both of these are the previously stated loopback addresses

---

> [!WARNING]
> Using this method will run the server on your computer and should only be used for debugging. This means anyone who navigates to it is *connecting directly to the hosting device*. This can be a significant security issue if you don't know what you're doing, so limit access to this website to your local network when 
hosting on a personal computer. If you want to host a public website, refer to the [public server instructions](#public-server).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NOTE: this is mostly irrelevant and *most* of the time your router will prevent anybody from accessing your computer directly the only times when someone might eb able to access this is if your router is exposing your private ip which does not happen by default or if someone on you same wifi or ethernet knows your private ip address
